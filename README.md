# Welcome to throwing away the JVM and still using the code

In this repository, their is code transpiled from java code. I've found a way to remove the jvm altogether and keep it mostly functioning.

The end result will be not needing the jvm, as all the code will already adhere to the equivalent functionality.

# What is the purpose of this repository?

To put the java app inside of python, javascript, & c/c++. 
But, mostly to keep away from having to use compiled code or boilerplate code.
But, this also exists for the purpose of using java like code on the web directly in the browser, either as javascript code, or as python code to use 
  with the brython.js module.
The point being this, the code is meant to run even in the web. Even if it is mostly python code.
